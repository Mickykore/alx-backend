# i18n Resources (Internationalization)

This repository contains code and resources for handling internationalization (i18n) in a Flask application. It allows for the display of content in different languages and localization of timestamps.

## Table of Contents

- [Learning Objectives](#learning-objectives)
- [Requirements](#requirements)

## Read or Watch

Before proceeding, it is recommended to read or watch the following resources:

- [Flask-Babel](https://flask-babel.tkte.ch/)
- [Flask i18n tutorial](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/RtGz7pI7TKnYqrMMG9rWMg)
- [pytz](https://pypi.org/project/pytz/)

## Learning Objectives

By working with the code and resources provided in this repository, you will:

- Learn how to parametrize Flask templates to display different languages
- Learn how to infer the correct locale based on URL parameters, user settings, or request headers
- Learn how to localize timestamps

## Requirements

To use this project, ensure you meet the following requirements:

- The code will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS using Python 3 (version 3.7)
- All files should end with a new line
- A `README.md` file, at the root of the project folder, is mandatory
- Your code should adhere to the `pycodestyle` style (version 2.5)
- The first line of all your files should be exactly `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- All your `*.py` files should be executable
- All your modules should have documentation (you can check this using `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").__doc__)'`)
- All your classes should have documentation (you can check this using `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.__doc__)'`)
- All your functions and methods should have documentation (you can check this using `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").my_function.__doc__)'` and `python3 -c 'print(__import__("my_module").MyClass.my_function.__doc__)'`)
- The documentation should be descriptive, providing real sentences explaining the purpose of the module, class, or method (the length of the documentation will be verified)
- All your functions and coroutines must be type-annotated.

Feel free to explore the contents of this repository and use the resources to enhance your Flask application's internationalization capabilities. If you have any questions or need assistance, refer to the documentation or reach out to the project maintainers. Happy coding!
