0x03. Queuing System in JS

# Redis and Queuing Project

In this project, you will learn how to work with Redis, a powerful in-memory data store, and build a basic Express application that interacts with a Redis server. Additionally, you will explore the concept of queuing and use Kue as a queue system in your project.

## Resources

Read or watch the following resources to get started:

- [Redis Quick Start](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/8xeApIhnxgFZkgn54BiIeA)
- [Redis Client Interface](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/1rq3ral-3C5O1t67dbGcWg)
- [Redis Client for Node.js](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/mRftfl67BrNvl-RM5JQfUA)
- [Kue (deprecated but still used in the industry)](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/yTC3Ci2IV2US24xJsBfMgQ)

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you will be able to explain the following concepts without using external references:

1. How to run a Redis server on your local machine.
2. How to perform simple operations with the Redis client.
3. How to use a Redis client with Node.js for basic operations.
4. How to store hash values in Redis.
5. How to handle asynchronous operations with Redis.
6. How to implement a basic Express application that interacts with a Redis server.
7. How to implement a basic Express application that interacts with a Redis server and uses a queue system (Kue).
